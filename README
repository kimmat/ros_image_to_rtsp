image_to_rtsp
==========
ROS Nodelet which uses GStreamer 0.10 RTSP Server to send sensor_msgs/Image messages via RTSP, for example to send a webcam image over network.

Mountpoint and GStreamer Pipeline is configured in launch file, example url to play the /rgb mountpoint:
rtsp://hostname:8554/rgb 

Note:
==========
- This package is still using GStreamer 0.10
- For the signals an updated gst-rtsp-server from git is needed which is not packaged in debian/ubuntu

TODO:
==========
- Update to GStreamer 1.x
